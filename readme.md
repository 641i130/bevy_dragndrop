## About
This is a simple crate that I've made because I realized the lack of existing crates to implement 
simple drag and drop functionality for bevy. This crate supports drag and drop for both UI and 2d 
world objects with options for modifiers and other mouse buttons. Contributions and issues for bug
reports or feature requests are welcome.
